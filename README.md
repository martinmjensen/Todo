## Check out the todo app here: [Link to demo](https://martinmjensen.github.io/Todo/)

**This a todo app is created with React, Redux and Redux Saga.**

The app uses the following dependencies:
- redux
- redux saga
- react spring
- sass


## Features

### Basic functionality
The todo does the typical todo-functionality; load todos, add todo, toggle completed state and remove todo. This is all done asynchronously using Redux Saga. Saga is a powerful middleware that handle all side-effects and ensures that the action creators stay pure.

### Responsiveness
The app is fully responsive and can be both enjoyed on the mobile as well as on desktop. Styling is done by using sass and each component has its own styling â€“ thereby adhering to reacts component reusability principle.

### Accessibility
Good support for accessibility. All of the app functions are fully accessible through the keyboard, and the accessibility tree is descriptive using semantic tags and aria-labels.
